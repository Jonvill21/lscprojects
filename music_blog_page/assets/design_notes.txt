Title: Music Blog Entry
(Get to know the Designer)

The project consists of creating a single page formatted as a blog entry to share your favorite top 10 music albums or songs of all time.

The blog entry should demonstrate intentional design and have all the elements of a blog (header, blog title, blog entry content, subtitle, and footer). It should include interesting content, graphics, and a visually appealing and clean layout.

The table must include at least 10 rows and 4 columns. Example: Song or album name, artist or band, genre, and song duration or year the album was published.
